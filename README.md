Codeigniter-Sessions-with-MongoDB-PHP-Driver
============================================

A Codeigniter library to use MongoDB with PHPs native MongoDB driver

Just put the MY_session.php file in your application/libraries directory and BOOM.  Currently it doesn't ask in config about this it just happens.  I will add a config item for setting it up later.

I used the https://github.com/navruzm/Codeigniter-MongoDB-Session to get the basics and then rewrote all the code for the PHP native driver because it works so well.
